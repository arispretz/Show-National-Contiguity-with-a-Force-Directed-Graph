# Show-National-Contiguity-with-a-Force-Directed-Graph

This is one of my projects in the way to achieve "Legacy Data Visualization" certification at freeCodeCamp.org. It was designed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, d3js and React.

User Story: I can see a Force-directed Graph that shows which countries share borders.

User Story: I can see each country's flag on its node.

Hint: Here's a dataset you can use to build this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DealPete/forceDirected/master/countries.json

Hint: You can create a spritesheet of national flags at https://www.flag-sprites.com.
